This is the notebook version of the code. I will use this to explain the homework.  I used parts of the code from: https://www.sanfoundry.com/python-program-solve-n-queen-problem-without-recursion/

As we did in class, we will represent the board as a one-dimensional array where each position in the arrray is the n'th queen's column value. So if the array is: [1, 3, 0, 2], then the first queen is in position 1 (of 4), the second queen is in position 3 (the last column), the third queen is in the first column and the last queen is the in the second position.

columns = [] #columns is the locations for each of the queens
# columns[r] is a number c if a queen is placed at row r and column c.
size = 8
import random #hint -- you will need this for the following code: column=random.randrange(0,size)

"""Let's setup one iteration of the British Museum algorithm-- we'll put down 4 queens randomly."""

def place_n_queens(size):
    columns.clear()
    row = 0
    while row < size:
        column=random.randrange(0,size-1)
        columns.append(column)
        row+=1

"""Now, we can print the result with a simple loop:"""

def display():
    for row in range(len(columns)):
        for column in range(size):
