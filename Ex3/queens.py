explication of the personal algorithm and executions:
I place in the first half of the rows queens with a space of 2 adn I begin in the second column.
When I do this, in all the first half of the board, all the queens don't "touch" the other queens.
We only have the last part left. And we this organisation of the first, we don't have to do a lot of backtrack
because the queens are in place that we could have a solution.
